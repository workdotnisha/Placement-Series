## DBMS 

#### DATA
- `Data => bits/bytes -> collection of raw bytes`
- `image -> collection of bytes`
- `integers -> collection of bytes`

- `Proccess/intepret -> meaning -> information`

- `Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observation, figures, symbols, and description of things etc`
- `In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself. Moreover, data is measured terms of bits and bytes which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage processing`
- `Data can be recordered and doesn't have any meaning unless processed.`


#### Information
- `Information is processes, organized, nad structured data.`
- `It provides context of the data and enables decision making.`
- `Processed data that make sense to us.`
- `Information is extended from the data, by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.`

### Types of data
- ####  Quantitative data
   - Numberical form

- ####  Qualitative data
    - Descriptive but not numerical

### Data Vs Information

| Data                                                  | Information                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| collection of facts                                   | put facts into context                                                       |
| raw and unorganized                                   | organized                                                                    |
| points are individual and sometimes unrelated         | maps out that data to provide a big-piture view of how it all fits together. |
| does not depends on information                       | depends on information                                                       |
| Comes in form of graph, numbers, figures, or stastics | presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas                       |
| not sufficient for decision making                    | suficient for decision making                                                |

## Database
- It is an electronic place or system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
- To make real use Data, we need `Database Management Systems(DBMS)`

## DBMS
- Collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. 
- Primary goal - to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
- Database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform
different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.

#### DBMS vs File systems
- Disadvantage of file processing system:
  - Data Redundancy and inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing Data
  - Data isolation
  - Integrity problems
  - Atomicity problems
  - Concurrent-access anomalies
  - Security problems
